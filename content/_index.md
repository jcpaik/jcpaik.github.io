# Jineon Baek

I am a fourth-year mathematics graduate student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. My advisor is [Michael Zieve](http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~zieve/).
You can check my CV [here](https://jcpaik.github.io/CV.pdf).

I am generally interested in combinatorics and computer science. 
Specifically, I have worked or am working on: discrete geometry, enumerative combinatorics, computer-assisted proofs, neural networks and programming language.
I am also interested in formal proofs and proof assistants.

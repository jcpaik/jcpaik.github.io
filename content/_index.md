# Jineon Baek

I am a postdoctoral researcher at Yonsei University in Seoul, Korea,
working under the mentorship of [Joonkyung Lee](https://sites.google.com/site/joonkyungleemaths/).

My main interests lie in optimization problems in combinatorics and geometry, that can appeal to a general audience through simple yet intriguing statements.

I completed my Ph. D. at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor,
under the supervision of [Michael Zieve](http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~zieve/).
My thesis focused on the moving sofa problem,
for which I am grateful to [Dan Romik](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~romik/)
for many thoughtful discussions and feedback during the course of the research.

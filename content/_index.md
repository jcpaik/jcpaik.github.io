# Jineon Baek

I am a postdoc at Yonsei University in Korea,
working under the mentorship of [Joonkyung Lee](https://sites.google.com/site/joonkyungleemaths/).

My primary interest is optimization problems in combinatorics and geometry.
Specifically, I have worked or am working on the following topics:

- Discrete geometry
- Enumerative combinatorics
- Computer-assisted Proofs
- Programming Language

I completed my Ph. D. at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor,
under the supervision of [Michael Zieve](http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~zieve/).
My thesis focused on the moving sofa problem,
for which I am grateful to [Dan Romik](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~romik/)
for many thoughtful discussions and feedback during the course of the research.

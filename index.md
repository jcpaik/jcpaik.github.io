# Jineon Baek

I am a third-year mathematics graduate student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. My advisor is [Michael Zieve](http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~zieve/).
You can check my CV [here](https://jcpaik.github.io/CV.pdf).

I am generally interested in combinatorics and computer science. 
Specifically, I have worked or am working on: discrete geometry, enumerative combinatorics, computer-assisted proofs, neural networks and programming language.
I am also interested in formal proofs and proof assistants.

Currently, I'm working on the moving sofa problem under the guidance of [Dan Romik](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~romik/). 
You can check his page on the [moving sofa problem](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~romik/movingsofa/) for a detailed description. 
My current work, which is still in progress, is hosted [here](https://github.com/jcpaik/sofa).
